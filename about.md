## - About

![Sprite](https://i.ibb.co/9cwtps3/Sprite1standleft.png)

Little Light was based on the idea that everyone has a little good in them, which over time evolved into the concept of our character wanting to bring well-being and happiness into his world. We felt that this concept was best represented by him lighting a candle to make the world a brighter place.

The story behind the game takes place at night following the death of a well-loved king. Our character happens upon the community, and seeing how sad everyone is, sets off to try and bring some happiness to them.
